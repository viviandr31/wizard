This survey usually takes approximately 20-30 minutes. You are free to answer the questions in several sittings; you can stop at any time knowing that your submitted answers are saved and you can return, at a later time, to pick up where you left off. You can go back to previous questions, to review and revise your responses, via the navigation tree on the right side of the screen.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease answer the survey questions with regard to the Interdiscilplinary Research Leaders project. Each question has a free-text box in which you can communicate with us about the question. You can explain your answer, provide examples illustrating your answer, comment on the question itself (i.e. did you understand what it was asking?), provide general feedback about the survey itself, or even to provide information about your project that we didnʻt think to ask but that you consider important.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>What you get out of this: </strong>At the end of the questions, you can generate a report that gives an overall assessment, based on your responses, of your project\'s strengths and points of potential weakness. For each potential weakness, we try to suggest an action you can take to remedy the situation, based on what has worked for others.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>What we get out of this:</strong> We have been studying long‐distance work for nearly twenty years. We have developed a theory about what makes these projects successful and what presents barriers to success. In order to test the theory, we need a lot of data both from different individuals within a project and across a lot of projects.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Concerns about privacy?</strong> Your data will be aggregated in any reports, either oral or written, so that your individual identity will not be revealed. We will ask for your permission if we can identify your role and project in publications after you have answered all the questions, so you have a sense of the sensitivity your answers may invoke.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Ethics:</strong> The University of California at Irvine’s Institutional Review Board has approved this research, under protocol HS#2013-9917. This approval certifies that you are answering these questions of your own free will, knowing what they will be used for, and that your privacy will be respected. You are free to stop answering these questions altogether, although we, of course, would like to see you finish so our data are balanced and complete.

Based on studies of over 200 collaborations, TORSC provides a set of five high-level categories that contribute to the success of collaborative projects.

However, we want to point out that as a diagnostic tool, it can only provide part of the picture. This report is generated automatically. It is based on your individual responses and does not take into account how your colleagues answered. The report uses only your numeric answers and cannot capture the richness of your text comments. As such, we can only provide general comments here that may be more or less relevant to your particular situation. Also, if you did not answer all the questions, the overview summaries may not be quite accurate. Once the survey period is complete, we will aggregate the responses and provide customized high-level feedback to the project as a whole.

A collaboration that works well is more likely to produce good outcomes. The Theory of Remote Scientific Collaboration (TORSC) identifies five areas of collaborative practice that guide our analysis:</div>\r\n\r\n<div> </div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>Nature of the Work:</strong> How is the work divided among sites, and how interdependent are the collaborators?</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>Common Ground:</strong> To what extend do collaborators share mutual knowledge, beliefs, language and assumptions?</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>Collaboration Readiness:</strong> Are participants motivated to work together? Are goals aligned? Do the participants get along?</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>Management, Planning, & Decision Making:</strong> How is the work organized and carried out? What organizational support is available?</div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>Technology Readiness:</strong> Are appropriate collaboration technologies available to the participants, are they comfortable using them, and is support available?</div>\r\n\r\n<div> </div>\r\n\r\n<div>Below, we provide a summary comment for each of these five categories. Then we provide more specific comments on individual questions that suggest collaborative strengths and identify areas that may need attention. </div>\r\n','<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<div>If you have any questions about our suggestions and feedback, or suggestions for improvement of the Wizard or this report, please address them to <a href=\"mailto:Hana-CSW@ics.uci.edi\">Hana-CSW@ics.uci.edu</a>.</div>\r\n\r\n<div> </div>\r\n\r\n<div>[1] Olson, J.

This survey usually takes approximately 20-30 minutes. You are free to answer the questions in several sittings; you can stop at any time knowing that your answers up to that time are saved and you can return at a later time to pick up where you left off. You can go back to previous questions, to review and revise your responses, via the navigation tree on the right side of the screen.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease answer the survey questions with regard to the SciTS @ UCI Project. Each question has a free-text box in which you can communicate with us about the question. You can explain your answer, provide examples illustrating your answer, comment on the question itself (i.e. did you understand what it was asking?), provide general feedback about the survey itself, or even to provide information about your project that we didnʻt think to ask but that you consider important.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>What you get out of this: </strong>At the end of the questions, you can generate a report that gives an overall assessment, based on your responses, of your project’s strengths and points of potential weakness. For each potential weakness, we try to suggest an action you can take to remedy the situation, based on what has worked for others.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>What we get out of this:</strong> We have been studying long‐distance work for nearly twenty years. We have developed a theory about what makes these projects successful and what presents barriers to success. In order to test the theory, we need a lot of data both from different individuals within a project and across a lot of projects.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Concerns about privacy?</strong> Your data will be aggregated in any reports, either oral or written, so that your individual identity will not be revealed. We will ask for your permission if we can identify your role and project in publications after you have answered all the questions, so you have a sense of the sensitivity your answers may invoke.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Ethics:</strong> The University of California at Irvine’s Institutional Review Board has approved this research, under protocol HS#2013-9917. This approval certifies that you are answering these questions of your own free will, knowing what they will be used for, and that your privacy will be respected. You are free to stop answering these questions altogether, although we, of course, would like to see you finish so our data are balanced and complete.

As such, we can only provide general comments that may be more or less relevant to your particular situation. Also, if you did not answer all the questions, the overview feedback may be less accurate.

A collaboration that works well is more likely to produce good outcomes. The Theory of Remote Scientific Collaboration (TORSC) identifies five areas of collaborative practice that guide our analysis:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><em>Nature of the Work</em>: How is the work divided among sites, and how interdependent are the collaborators?</li>\r\n	<li><em>Common Ground</em>: To what extend do collaborators share mutual knowledge, beliefs, language and assumptions?</li>\r\n	<li><em>Collaboration Readiness</em>: Are participants motivated to work together? Are goals aligned? Do the participants get along?</li>\r\n	<li><em>Management, Planning, & Decision Making</em>: How is the work organized and carried out? What organizational support is available?</li>\r\n	<li><em>Technology Readiness</em>: Are appropriate collaboration technologies available to the participants, are they comfortable using them, and is support available?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Below, we first provide a summary comment for each of these five categories. Then we provide more specific comments on individual questions that suggest collaborative strengths and areas that may need improvement. </p>\r\n','<p>If you have any questions about our suggestions and feedback, or suggestions for improvement of the Wizard or this report, please address them to <a href=\"mailto:Hana-CSW@ics.uci.edu\">Hana-CSW@ics.uci.edu</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[1] Olson, J.

One of the goals of the Wizard is to provide an opportunity to reflect on your collaborative practices, guided by findings from decades of research on the challenges collaborating across distance.</p>\n<p>\n	The Wizard was developed based on the Theory of Remote Scientific Collaboration (TORSC) [1]. Based on studies of over 200 collaborations, TORSC provides a set of five high-level categories that contribute to the success of collaborative projects. In this report, we outline each of the categories and provide feedback and collaborative strategies based on the answers you provided to our questions and best practices that have been successfully used&nbsp;in other projects.</p>\n<p>\n	We hope that you find this personal report a useful tool for reflection and discussion with your colleagues. However, we want to point out that as a diagnostic tool, it can only provide part of the picture. This report is generated automatically. It is based on your individual responses and does not take into account how your colleagues answered. The report uses only your numeric answers and cannot capture the richness of your text comments. As such, we can only provide general comments that may be more or less relevant to your particular situation. Also, if you did not answer all the questions, the overview feedback may be less accurate. Once the survey period is complete, we will aggregate the responses and provide customized high-level feedback to the project as a whole. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us at <a href=\"mailto:hana-csw@uci.edu\">hana-csw@uci.edu</a>.<br />\n	&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Theory of Remote Scientific Collaboration</strong><br />\n	The Collaboration Success Wizard provides guidance about collaborative practices that tend to lead to successful outcomes. A collaboration that works well is more likely to produce good outcomes. The Theory of Remote Scientific Collaboration (TORSC) identifies five areas of collaborative practice that guide our analysis:</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>\n		<em>Nature of the Work</em>: How is the work divided among sites, and how interdependent are the collaborators?</li>\n	<li>\n		<em>Common Ground</em>: To what extend do collaborators share mutual knowledge, beliefs, language and assumptions?</li>\n	<li>\n		<em>Collaboration Readiness</em>: Are participants motivated to work together? Are goals aligned? Do the participants get along?</li>\n	<li>\n		<em>Management, Planning, &amp; Decision Making</em>: How is the work organized and carried out? What organizational support is available?</li>\n	<li>\n		<em>Technology Readiness</em>: Are appropriate collaboration technologies available to the participants, are they comfortable using them, and is support available?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n	Below, we first provide a summary comment for each of these five categories. Then we provide more specific comments on individual questions that suggest collaborative strengths and areas that may need improvement.&nbsp;</p>\n','<p>\n	If you have any questions about our suggestions and feedback, or suggestions for improvement of the Wizard or this report, please address them to <a href=\"mailto:Hana-CSW@ics.uci.edu\">Hana-CSW@ics.uci.edu</a>.</p>\n<p>\n	[1] Olson, J.

You can go back to previous questions, to review and revise your responses, via the navigation tree on the right side of the screen.<br />\n<br />\nPlease answer the survey questions with regard to the XXXX Supports project. Each question has a free-text box in which you can communicate with us about the question. You can explain your answer, provide examples illustrating your answer, comment on the question itself (i.e. did you understand what it was asking?), provide general feedback about the survey itself, or even to provide information about your project that we didnʻt think to ask but that you consider important.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>What you get out of this: </strong>At the end of the questions, you can generate a report that gives an overall assessment, based on your responses, of your project\'s strengths and points of potential weakness. For each potential weakness, we try to suggest an action you can take to remedy the situation, based on what has worked for others.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>What we get out of this:</strong> We have been studying long‐distance work for nearly twenty years. We have developed a theory about what makes these projects successful and what presents barriers to success. In order to test the theory, we need a lot of data both from different individuals within a project and across a lot of projects.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Concerns about privacy?</strong> Your data will be aggregated in any reports, either oral or written, so that your individual identity will not be revealed. We will ask for your permission if we can identify your role and project in publications after you have answered all the questions, so you have a sense of the sensitivity your answers may invoke.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Ethics:</strong> The University of California at Irvine’s Institutional Review Board has approved this research, under protocol HS#2013-9917.

In this report, we outline each of the categories and provide feedback and collaborative strategies based on the answers you provided to our questions and best practices that have been successfully used in other projects.</div>\n<div>\n	&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n	We hope that you find this personal report a useful tool for reflection and discussion with your colleagues. However, we want to point out that as a diagnostic tool, it can only provide part of the picture. This report is generated automatically. It is based on your individual responses and does not take into account how your colleagues answered. The report uses only your numeric answers and cannot capture the richness of your text comments. As such, we can only provide general comments here that may be more or less relevant to your particular situation. Also, if you did not answer all the questions, the overview summaries may not be quite accurate. Once the survey period is complete, we will aggregate the responses and provide customized high-level feedback to the project as a whole. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:Hana-CSW@ics.uci.edu&quot;&gt;Hana-CSW@ics.uci.edu&lt;/a&gt;.</div>\n<div>\n	&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n	<strong>Theory of Remote Scientific Collaboration</strong></div>\n<div>\n	The Collaboration Success Wizard provides guidance about collaborative practices that tend to lead to successful outcomes. A collaboration that works well is more likely to produce good outcomes. The Theory of Remote Scientific Collaboration (TORSC) identifies five areas of collaborative practice that guide our analysis:</div>\n<div>\n	&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n	<strong>Nature of the Work:</strong> How is the work divided among sites, and how interdependent are the collaborators?</div>\n<div>\n	<strong>Common Ground:</strong> To what extend do collaborators share mutual knowledge, beliefs, language and assumptions?</div>\n<div>\n	<strong>Collaboration Readiness:</strong> Are participants motivated to work together? Are goals aligned? Do the participants get along?</div>\n<div>\n	<strong>Management, Planning, &amp; Decision Making:</strong> How is the work organized and carried out? What organizational support is available?</div>\n<div>\n	<strong>Technology Readiness:</strong> Are appropriate collaboration technologies available to the participants, are they comfortable using them, and is support available?</div>\n<div>\n	&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n	Below, we provide a summary comment for each of these five categories. Then we provide more specific comments on individual questions that suggest collaborative strengths and identify areas that may need attention.&nbsp;</div>\n','<p>\n	 </p>\n<div>\n	If you have any questions about our suggestions and feedback, or suggestions for improvement of the Wizard or this report, please address them to <a href=\"mailto:Hana-CSW@ics.uci.edi\">Hana-CSW@ics.uci.edu</a>.</div>\n<div>\n	 </div>\n<div>\n	[1] Olson, J.
